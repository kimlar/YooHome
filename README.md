This project is something that I did on the side while studying SQL. I wanted to create simple but functional C# application for handling SQL-qurries. The purpose was to demonstrate a functional shop in-house application, which runs query on the SQL db to keep track of what is currently in their storage. Also to follow all active orders from their customers. If for instance a customer calls you could just ask for their order-id then you simply enter the id and then the complete order gets displayed.
